# Interactive_Metro

This project is made with Python and uses Pygames. It's meant to allow the user to calculate how accurate their attempts to match a metronome in milliseconds.

Currently, I'm awaiting instructions from the production manager about what is expected for the implimentation for the interface.

To test the code out, make sure to have pygame installed. Run the program, initially ignore the pop up screen and enter the desired bpm into the terminal. Go to the game window that's popped up. Press P to start the metronome, S to stop the metronome, left and right to change the tempo and space to tap. Every time you tap it will be measured against the beat you attempt to match. After closing the window a list will produce of your attempts to match the metronome. The list is in milliseconds.
