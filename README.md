# Interactive_Metro

This project is made with Python and uses Pygames. It's meant to allow the user to calculate how accurate their attempts to match a metronome in milliseconds. Start the project, press P to play the metronome sound and s to pause the metronome. Left and Right arrows to decrease or increase the tempo, and space bar to record an attempt to match the beat. Esc exits the program and you should notice a list of your attempts in miliseconds.
